In [Content Management](../content-management), you have already learned about all kinds of content of Eureka. Next, we will introduce Eureka's customization options. Customize Eureka will lead you to understand how Eureka is configured and its options.

<!--more-->

## Navigation Bar

You can define the content of the web page navigation bar simply and quickly. In `config/_default/menus.yaml`, there are multiple `main` modules, just modify them according to the content in the sample file. For example, adding the archive page in the navigation bar only needs to add the following content:

```yaml
main:
  - name: Archive
    url: /archive/
    weight: 40
```

It should be noted that the order of the navigation bar is in ascending order of the size of `weight`.

## Highlight

Eureka uses highlight.js to render code highlighting. If you need to configure highlight.js, you only need to configure the `highlight` in `config/_default/params.yaml`.

**highlight.handler(string)**

The optional value is highlightjs.

**highlight.highlightjs.languages(list)**

Highlight.js will include some common languages by default, and other languages can be configured through this property. See [Available Languages](https://github.com/highlightjs/cdn-release/tree/master/build/languages).

**highlight.highlightjs.style(string)**

Eureka uses the solarized-light style of highlight.js by default, and the style used can be configured through this property. See [Available Styles](https://github.com/highlightjs/cdn-release/tree/master/build/styles).

## Math

Eureka supports the use of KaTeX to render LaTeX mathematical formulas. If you need to configure KaTeX, you only need to configure the `math` in `config/_default/params.yaml`.

**math.handler(string)**

The optional value is `katex`, leave it blank to disable this feature.

**math.katex(object)**

KaTeX related configuration. For specific optional values, please refer to: [Options · KaTeX](https://katex.org/docs/options.html). Since Eureka uses KaTeX's auto-render extension, the `displayMode` property in the link will be ignored.

Because Hugo's config params are case-insensitive, you need to add `-` or `_` before the uppercase letters. For example, `throwOnError` should be written as `throw-On-Error` or other acceptable formats.

Eureka also supports independent configuration of whether to render math formula for each page or section. For example, you have a project with the following file structure:

```
content/
├── posts
│   ├── post-1.md
│   ├── post-2.md
│   └── ...
│
└── docs
    ├── doc-1
    │   ├── content-1.md
    │   ├── content-2.md
    |   ├── nested-doc
    │   |   ├── nested-content-1.md
    │   |   ├── nested-content-2.md
    |   |   └── _index.md
    │   └── _index.md
    └── ...
```

You can set the value of the `enableMath` attribute in the Front Matter of the file in any level, which will affect this page or all pages under this section. The priority is Page > Section > Site. For example, if I set `enableMath: fasle` in Front Matter of `nested-doc` and set `enableMath: true` in Front Matter of `nested-content-1.md`, it will make `nested-content-1.md` render math formulas. Formulas in other files under the `nested-doc` folder will not be rendered.

## Comment

Eureka supports using Disqus, Utterances, Valine, Waline and Commento as comment system。If you need to configure comment, you just need to configure the `comment` in `config/_default/params.yaml`

Eureka also supports independent configuration of whether to enable comment for each page or section. For example, you have a project with the following file structure:

```
content/
├── posts
│   ├── post-1.md
│   ├── post-2.md
│   └── ...
│
└── docs
    ├── doc-1
    │   ├── content-1.md
    │   ├── content-2.md
    |   ├── nested-doc
    │   |   ├── nested-content-1.md
    │   |   ├── nested-content-2.md
    |   |   └── _index.md
    │   └── _index.md
    └── ...
```

You can set the value of the `enableComment` attribute in the Front Matter of the file in any level, which will affect this page or all pages under this section. The priority is Page > Section > Site. For example, if I set `enableComment: fasle` in Front Matter of `nested-doc` and set `enableComment: true` in Front Matter of `nested-content-1.md`, it will make `nested-content-1.md` enable comment. Comment in other files under the `nested-doc` folder will not be enabled.

**comment.handler(string)**

The optional value is `disqus`, `utterances`, `valine`, `waline` and `commento`, leave it blank to disable this feature.

**comment.disqus.shortname(string)**

The shortname of Disqus.

**comment.utterances(object)**

Utterances related configuration. For specific optional values, please refer to: [utterances](https://utteranc.es/). If you want the color scheme of utterances to follow eureka's, you can set `theme` to `eureka` in config params.

**comment.valine(object)**

Valine related configuration. For specific optional values, please refer to: [Config Reference | Valine](https://valine.js.org/en/configuration.html).

Because Hugo's config params are case-insensitive, you need to add `-` or `_` before the uppercase letters. For example, `appId` should be written as `app-Id` or other acceptable formats.

**comment.waline(object)**

Waline related configuration. For specific optional values, please refer to: [Client Options | Waline](https://waline.js.org/en/reference/client.html).Note that you need to add `-` or `_` before the uppercase letters. For example, `pageSize` should be written as `page_Size` or other acceptable formats.

Dark mode follows Eureka on, if you need to customize the style, you can add CSS style in `layouts/partials/comment/waline.html` to override, for more details, please refer to [Custom style | Waline](https://waline.js.org/en/guide/client/style.html).

**comment.commento.url**

If self-hosting, please enter the url (e.g. https://commento.example.com) here. Otherwise leave empty.

## Diagram

Eureka supports the use of Mermaid to render diagrams. If you need to configure Mermaid, you only need to configure the `diagram` in `config/_default/params.yaml`.

**diagram.handler(string)**

The optional value is `mermaid`, leave it blank to disable this feature.

**diagram.mermaid(object)**

Mermaid related configuration. For specific optional values, please refer to: [Configuration handling in Mermaid API](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/Setup).

Because Hugo's config params are case-insensitive, you need to add `-` or `_` before the uppercase letters. For example, `diagramPadding` should be written as `diagram-Padding` or other acceptable formats.
